    <h1>The internet should be connected but decentralized.</h1>
    <p>We've abdicated the potential of the internet.</p>
    <p>We live in a world of data silos. A world where people have very little control over their siloed data. A world where extracting data from silos is a chore. A world where data scientists spend 70% of their job just extracting and cleaning data for their silos when their time could be spent in more important places. A world where many teams within even the same company face challenges with sharing data between silos. A world where AI is limited by the restriction of silos.</p>
    <p>Data interoperability is core to the Semantic Web, but at the moment, linked data is just as siloed as other forms of data.</p>
    <p>Yet, these problems aren't endemic to the internet.</p>
    <p>They're solvable.</p>
    <p>That is O's mission.</p>

    <p>O is working to achieve global data interoperability. The first step is building a concensus around schemas via <a href="https://shaperepo.com">ShapeRepo.com</a>.</p>
