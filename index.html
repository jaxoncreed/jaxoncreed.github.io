    <h1>The internet should be connected but decentralized.</h1>
    <p>It’s been said before, and I’ll be the thousandth person to repeat it. We’ve abdicated the potential of the internet.</p>
    <p>What promised to be a collaborative environment where everyone could have a small slice of a digital world has become proportioned into kingdoms ruled by mega-entities.</p>
    <p>We live in a world of data silos. A world where people have very little control over their siloed data. A world where extracting data from silos is a chore. A world where data scientists spend 70% of their job just extracting and cleaning data for their silos when their time could be spent in more important places. A world where many teams within even the same company face challenges with sharing data between silos. A world where AI is limited by the restriction of silos.</p>
    <p>Solutions have been proposed, but the developer community has largely rejected the “Semantic Web.” It’s not scalable. It’s designed for static data when event-based data rules. It lacks the control needed for a modern organization. It’s not accessible to developers.</p>
    <p>Yet, these problems aren’t endemic to the internet.</p>
    <p>They’re solvable.</p>
    <p>That is O’s mission.</p>
